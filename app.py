        This project utilizes machine learning to analyze quiz scores and predict an applicant's likelihood of having dyslexia. The dataset contains scores from various sections:
        - Language Vocabulary
        - Memory
        - Processing Speed
        - Visual Discrimination
        - Auditory Discrimination
        In addition, a survey score is included. These scores are used to determine a "Dyslexia Risk Label" ranging from 0 to 2:
        - 0: Low Risk
        - 1: Moderate Risk
        - 2: High Risk
        This model aims to identify individuals who might benefit from further evaluation for dyslexia.

        - Decision Tree
        - Random Forest

        On the basis of our findings, we then created the final model using RandomForestClassifier with GridSearchCV in order to make the most accurate predictions, in 'DyslexiaML_final' file. This model was then tested on a new dataset to find the labels, which were then compared with the actual label values. After this check we found out that our model was able to make predictions for dyslexia with a 5.8% error rate.
